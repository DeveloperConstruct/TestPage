        <p><b>>I</b>t was the dead of night and I was riding in a wagon to an unknown location in the woods with someone I had met about an hour ago. All because I really need some money…</p>

<p>I met George Mortez at the saloon earlier that evening. I had gone there to play cards with whomever was there at the time. I had just lost, hard. I must admit, I wasn’t all that good at playing cards. The thing is, I knew it back then too, but I was so desperate that I had talked myself into going for it. I Was doing quite badly with money and I knew that people won big at the saloon. I had witnessed it in the evenings when I would be drinking there after working all day. I never really dared playing with the people who were there, but tonight, after having a drink, I finally decided to give it a shot. I went to the table I usually avoided where a pack of men were playing some poker. I was confident that I could win something. One win and that's all I need. I had played with some people I worked with so I had a bit of experience. As I asked about joining the game a few heads around the table looked up for a split second and then a man closest to me told me to sit down. His voice was as rasp as gravel on the roads.</p>

<p>The game didn’t start out too bad. I thought I might play for a bit and leave at the first chance I got, If I managed to win anything. It looked like I could manage to collect a good enough hand from the cards that were dealt to me. Unfortunately, that evening wasn’t the right time to attempt such a stunt because I didn’t know that one of the men I was playing against was known to be good at the game. That's what the bartender later told me at least. In fact, the same man who invited me to the game. He definitely knew what he was doing. I was just a wallet waiting to be robbed empty.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, whatever money I had left to my name, whatever I had put on the table was gone. All of it was overturned to the winners. I could have stopped at my first loss but I was sure that eventually I could turn the tide in my favor. Not even close. The other players just kept laughing  through cigarette smoke and told me to have better luck next time as they pocketed the money. The only good thing about the whole mess was that at least at the end, I was at a place with alcohol. I spent my last money on a drink that I sipped while thinking about how I should have stayed out of this place and never picked up cards in my life. The saloon was as busy as ever late in the evening and an indistinct loud chatter filled the entire floor. People smoking and drinking. Some about to fight, some downed, already losers in past fight</p>

<p>As I sat at the bar, I thought about my father who had recently passed away. I was having a hard time sustaining myself financially because of it. His death was sudden and no one had expected it. I knew he was I'll for a while but not long ago it got worse and after just a few short days he was gone. I lived with him in a town that was far away from here. There was no other choice for me but to leave and go to find work at the nearby town. Now that he was gone, my wellbeing was all up to me. It was just me and him back then. Any other family beside that were totally unknown to me. I had no idea who my mother was and my father didn’t ever bother explaining that to me. I suppose I could understand that it must have broken his heart just thinking of her, so I didn’t ever ask. As far as I knew, their relations had never been great. It wasn't a rare occurrence around a place like that. There wasn't any real work around town either. I had some jobs here and there but nothing that could give me any real calm about even my immediate future.</p>

<p>Time went on and It was getting quite late in the night. The saloon had cleared out a bit already. My stool hadn't moved an inch. The bartender asked me If I wanted another drink. I replied that I did, but I had just spent my very last dime on the previous one. It would have to be all for now.</p>

<p>Next to me sat a fellow who had come in the bar a bit earlier, a while after I sat down there. He had heard that I had declined the drink and loomed over in my direction. He offered to buy me one more. I was more than surprised at his generosity. Without thinking I of course agreed. It’s not everyday that you get a free drink around here. He bought himself another drink too while he was at it. </p>

<p>He didn't say anything at first, but I felt like having a chat with someone. I inquired about where he was from because to me he didn’t look like a local. I’d never seen him before. He put down his glass and told me his name was George. I asked if he was from here. He signed "no". 
"Somerton." George said in a dry tone.
I hadn't heard of such a town before, but I didn’t know much else about it besides the name.</p>

<p>George looked of Spanish Mexican descent, with a dark and somewhat pointy, not too long beard and a mustache. He had dark, mid-length hair. His language seemed to be more like one spoken here but I could notice a slight accent in his words. He had set his sun hat on the table. I could see a revolver holstered by his side. I couldn't tell if he was the type to ever use it on anyone.</p>

<p>He didn't seem like he wanted to talk much but I couldn't not talk to someone at that moment. I did not wish to be in my head mulling over my current and past misfortunes. To my surprise, George actually took a moment to briefly explain where it was and a little of what it was like there. It was located a bit further west from here and by the way he explained it to me I got the idea that it was bigger and brighter than this place I unwillingly called home right now. George also seemed to be somewhat more educated than me by the manner he talked. Afterwards he turned the question to me and asked me if I was a town local. I told him that I wouldn’t  call myself that. Then it got quiet again. Afterward I drunkenly asked him if he’d be up for a game of cards. To no one's surprise, George declined.</p>

<p>I was just kind of talking to myself for a while in the direction of George. I told him that I was shoveling coal at the trainyard from the train cars during the day. He didn't say anything about his work to me.</p>

<p>"You're handy with a shovel then, right?" George suddenly asked me.</p>

<p>"...I suppose so." </p>
<p>George then turned his head at me which he had done only about once so far.</p>
<p>"It's just that I... need something done."</p>
<p>Any job was good for me at that point so I perked up my ears.</p>
 <p>“It’s nothing too difficult…"</p>
<p>George paused to take a swig of his drink. Then he continued.</p>
<p>"...but it has to be done right away.”</p>
<p>A part of me deep down inside under the liquor  wanted to remind him that it was probably past midnight already and we were drunk as pirates.</p>
<p>"Right now?" That's all I managed to ask.</p>
<p>“Don't worry. It shouldn’t take too long,” he replied without hesitation.</p>
<p>I asked once more about what would have to be done, but he just told me that he’ll tell me about it on the way. I went along with whatever he had planned. He looked like someone I could trust in contrast to those fools that had just taken my money and laughed in my face.</p>

<p>George finished his drink, stood up from the chair and put some money down on the counter. His posture was a bit wobbly from the drinking but he straightened himself out rather fast. With a gesture of his hand he waved that we should get going. I asked him if maybe we could have one more drink first, but as I’d probably should have expected, he said that I can do that later by myself. That's a sign that I'll at least have enough money for a drink. I finished whatever I had left in my glass, put on my scruffy hat that I had put on the counter top and got off the chair to follow George who was already walking out the saloon door.</p>

<p>Outside, behind the saloon stood George's horse with a wagon. I was surprised he just left it there unaccounted for. He didn't seem like a careless person. He then proceeded to untie the horse from the post it was left at. Finally, he started telling me about what we’ll be doing.</p>
“I didn’t want to say it in there but I’ve got some… cargo I have to offload. Not far from here. I need to do it rather quickly too."</p>
He then said that he has to be on his way out of this town by the morning light. He was quite tired and that’s why he was glad he'd found an extra pair of hands to help him out.</p>

<p>His proposition seemed like something I could help with so I agreed to it. George just nodded and said that that’s good. He told me to get in the back of the wagon where a pile of bags lay inside, on the floor. I noticed that there were a few holes torn in the fabric of the roof and sides. He got in the wagon with me and we began to ride away from the saloon. Soon we were out and away from the borders of Achersville. </p>

<p>George was a complete stranger to me. But one thing was for sure. I didn’t get the impression that I should be scared of him. He couldn’t rob me just simply based on the simple fact that I had no money. That was the main thing to look out for around here.</p>

<p>We got to the woods and I had actually begun to doze off a bit because it was really late, I was quite tired and the whiskey was doing its part. George suddenly tapped me on the shoulder and told me that we had reached our destination. I heard him jump out of the caravan and take a shovel out of the wagon that had laid there on the floor beside him. I followed suit. The forest wasn't too dense as they were around there. Pine, oak elm trees stood around us, accompanying us in our nightly expedition. George seemed to be looking for a spot in the ground that would suit his needs. Once he'd found it, he planted the shovel into the ground. He then told me to help him get all of the bags out of the wagon and put them beside it. They were all quite heavy. Furthest from all the bags was a tent that had been rolled up. When I took a closer look at it it seemed to be used to wrap something. It was quite dark however and I couldn’t really tell anything apart too well. After we got the bags out of the way, George got in the wagon and told me to take the one end of the tent and help him take it out. I got back up on the wagon and reached for one of the ends. As I grabbed it a shock went through my spine and I froze up. George sighed and kept looking down.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. Just help me get it out and on the ground. I’ll explain everything.”</p>
<p>I didn’t hesitate because I couldn’t really think straight. I just did as he told me.</p>
<p>After we had put it on the ground we stood above the tent and George lit a cigarette he took from his jacket's inner pocket. He offered me one and I accepted it. He gave me some matches to light mine as well.</p>
<p>“That’s Sir James Blackwell, I’m afraid…” George said as he exhaled the cigarette fumes. “My soon to be Father In Law.”</p>
<p>I looked up at him but he was looking away from me. Seemingly fixated at something in the distance, but nothing in particular at the same time. I couldn't find any words to reply to him.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect to haul a body tonight..” I said in a daze.</p>
<p>“Neither did I.”</p>
