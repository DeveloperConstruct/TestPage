        <p>It was the dead of night and I was riding in a wagon to an unknown location in the woods with someone I had met about an hour ago. All because I really need some money…</p>

<p>I met George Mortez at the saloon earlier that evening. I had gone there to play cards with whomever was there at the time. I had just lost, hard. I must admit, I wasn’t all that good at playing cards. The thing is, I knew it back then too, but I was so desperate that I had talked myself into going for it. I Was doing quite badly with money and I knew that people won big at the saloon. I had witnessed it in the evenings when I would be drinking there after working all day. I never really dared playing with the people who were there, but tonight, after having a drink, I finally decided to give it a shot. I went to the table I usually avoided where a pack of men were playing some poker. I was confident that I could win something. One win and that's all I need. I had played with some people I worked with so I had a bit of experience. As I asked about joining the game a few heads around the table looked up for a split second and then a man closest to me told me to sit down. His voice was as rasp as gravel on the roads.</p>

<p>The game didn’t start out too bad. I thought I might play for a bit and leave at the first chance I got, If I managed to win anything. It looked like I could manage to collect a good enough hand from the cards that were dealt to me. Unfortunately, that evening wasn’t the right time to attempt such a stunt because I didn’t know that one of the men I was playing against was known to be good at the game. That's what the bartender later told me at least. In fact, the same man who invited me to the game. He definitely knew what he was doing. I was just a wallet waiting to be robbed empty.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, whatever money I had left to my name, whatever I had put on the table was gone. All of it was overturned to the winners. I could have stopped at my first loss but I was sure that eventually I could turn the tide in my favor. Not even close. The other players just kept laughing  through cigarette smoke and told me to have better luck next time as they pocketed the money. The only good thing about the whole mess was that at least at the end, I was at a place with alcohol. I spent my last money on a drink that I sipped while thinking about how I should have stayed out of this place and never picked up cards in my life. The saloon was as busy as ever late in the evening and an indistinct loud chatter filled the entire floor. People smoking and drinking. Some about to fight, some downed, already losers in past fight</p>

<p>As I sat at the bar, I thought about my father who had recently passed away. I was having a hard time sustaining myself financially because of it. His death was sudden and no one had expected it. I knew he was I'll for a while but not long ago it got worse and after just a few short days he was gone. I lived with him in a town that was far away from here. There was no other choice for me but to leave and go to find work at the nearby town. Now that he was gone, my wellbeing was all up to me. It was just me and him back then. Any other family beside that were totally unknown to me. I had no idea who my mother was and my father didn’t ever bother explaining that to me. I suppose I could understand that it must have broken his heart just thinking of her, so I didn’t ever ask. As far as I knew, their relations had never been great. It wasn't a rare occurrence around a place like that. There wasn't any real work around town either. I had some jobs here and there but nothing that could give me any real calm about even my immediate future.</p>

<p>Time went on and It was getting quite late in the night. The saloon had cleared out a bit already. My stool hadn't moved an inch. The bartender asked me If I wanted another drink. I replied that I did, but I had just spent my very last dime on the previous one. It would have to be all for now.</p>

<p>Next to me sat a fellow who had come in the bar a bit earlier, a while after I sat down there. He had heard that I had declined the drink and loomed over in my direction. He offered to buy me one more. I was more than surprised at his generosity. Without thinking I of course agreed. It’s not everyday that you get a free drink around here. He bought himself another drink too while he was at it. </p>

<p>He didn't say anything at first, but I felt like having a chat with someone. I inquired about where he was from because to me he didn’t look like a local. I’d never seen him before. He put down his glass and told me his name was George. I asked if he was from here. He signed "no". 
"Somerton." George said in a dry tone.
I hadn't heard of such a town before, but I didn’t know much else about it besides the name.</p>

<p>George looked of Spanish Mexican descent, with a dark and pointy, not too long beard and a mustache. He had regular mid-length hair. His language seemed to be more like one spoken here but I could notice a slight accent in his words. He had set his sun hat on the table. I could see a revolver holstered by his side. I couldn't tell if he was the type to ever use it on anyone.</p>

<p>He didn't seem like he wanted to talk much but I couldn't not talk to someone at that moment. I did not wish to be in my head mulling over my current and past misfortunes. To my surprise, George actually took a moment to briefly explain where it was and a little of what it was like there. It was located a bit further west from here and by the way he explained it to me I got the idea that it was bigger and brighter than this place I unwillingly called home right now. George also seemed to be somewhat more educated than me by the manner he talked. Afterwards he turned the question to me and asked me if I was a town local. I told him that I wouldn’t  call myself that. Then it got quiet again. Afterward I drunkenly asked him if he’d be up for a game of cards. To no one's surprise, George declined.</p>
