        It was the dead of night and I was riding in a wagon to an unknown location in the woods with someone I had met about an hour ago. All because I really need some money.

I met George Mortez at the saloon earlier that evening. I had gone there to play cards with whomever was there at the time and I’d lost, hard. I wasn’t all that good at playing cards. I was doing quite badly with money and I knew that people won big at the saloon from the times I’d witnessed it from drinking there in the evenings. I never really dared playing with the people who were there, but tonight, after having a drink, I finally decided to give it a shot. I was confident that I would win. The game didn’t start out too bad either. We played poker and I thought I might play for a bit and leave at the first chance I got, If I managed to win anything. Unfortunately, that evening wasn’t the right time to attempt such a stunt because I didn’t know that one of the men I was playing against was known to be good at the game. Before I knew it, whatever money I had left to my name, whatever I had put on the table was gone. All of it was overturned to the winners. I could have stopped at my first loss but I was sure that eventually I could turn the tide in my favor. Not even close. The other players just kept laughing  through cigarette smoke and told me to have better luck next time as they pocketed the money. The only good thing about the whole mess was that at least at the end, I was at a bar. I spent my last money on a drink that I sipped while thinking about how I should have stayed out of this place and never picked up cards in my life.

As I sat at the bar, I thought about my father who had recently passed away. I was having a hard time sustaining myself financially because of it. His death was sudden and no one had expected it. I knew he was Ill for a while but not long ago it got worse and after just a few short days he was gone. I lived with him in a town that was far away from here. I left home and went to find work at a nearby town. Now that he was gone, my wellbeing was all up to me. It was just me and him because I didn’t have any other family beside that. I had no idea who my mother was and my father didn’t ever bother explaining that to me. I suppose I could understand that it must have broken his heart just thinking of her, so I didn’t ever ask. As far as I knew, their relations had never been great. There wasn't any real work around here either. I had some jobs here and there but nothing that could give me any stability.

It was getting quite late in the night. The bartender asked me If I wanted another drink but I replied that I had just spent my last dime. It would have to be all for now. Next to me sat a fellow who had come in the bar a bit earlier, a while after I sat down there. He had heard that I had declined the drink and offered to buy me one more. I was surprised at his generosity. Without thinking I of course agreed. It’s not everyday that you get a free drink around here. He bought himself another drink too and we struck up a chat. I inquired about where he was from because to me he didn’t look like a local. I’d never seen him before. He told me his name was George and that he was from Somerton. I had heard of such a town before, but I didn’t know much else about it besides the name. He took a bit of time to explain where it was and a little of what it was like there. It was located a bit further west from here and by the way he explained it to me I got the idea that it was bigger and brighter than this place I called home. After a while of talking I figured that he was somewhat more educated than me as well. Afterwards he turned the question to me and asked me if I was a town local. I told him that I wouldn’t  call myself that. I asked him if he’d be up for a game of cards. Maybe I could win some money from him. George declined. 

We sat and drank for a little while until he asked me if I needed some money, since I had revealed to be broke. Without thinking I told him that I, in fact, do need it. He said that he has a job that needs doing. If I'd help him out he’d pay me accordingly. Being penniless was no good for anyone around here, since I couldn’t even pay for a place to stay the night. I agreed to whatever job he had in mind. He asked me if I was sure and I said that I was. Only afterwards did I even wonder to ask him what kind of work he was offering.
 “It’s nothing too difficult but it has to be done right away.” He said.
I thought I didn’t hear him correctly. I reminded him that we were drinking and that it was probably past midnight already. That didn’t seem to bother him.
“It shouldn’t take too long,” he said.
I asked once more about what would have to be done, but he just told me that he’ll tell me about it on the way. It didn’t really bother me and so I went along with whatever he had planned. He looked like someone I could trust in contrast to those fools that had just taken my money and laughed in my face.

George finished his drink and stood up from the chair and put some money down on the counter. His posture was a bit wobbly from the drinking but he straightened himself out. With a gesture of his hand he waved that we should get going. I asked him if maybe we could have one more drink first, but as I’d half expected, he said that I can do that later by myself. I finished whatever I had left in my glass, put on my hat that had stood on the counter top and got off the chair to follow George who was already walking out the saloon door.
Outside, behind the saloon stood George's horse with a wagon. He untied the horse from the post it was left at and finally started telling me about what we’ll be doing.
“I didn’t want to say it in there but I’ve got some… cargo I have to offload. Not far from here. I need to do it rather quickly too. 
He then said that he has to be on his way out of this town by the morning light. He was quite tired and that’s why he needed an extra pair of hands to help him.
It seemed like something I could help with so I agreed to help out. George just nodded and said that that’s good. The horse had a wagon attached to it. He told me to get in the back of it where a pile of bags lay inside, on the floor. He got in the wagon with me and we began to ride away from the saloon and soon we were out and away from the borders of the town.

George  was a complete stranger to me. One thing was for sure. I didn’t get the impression that I should be scared of him. He couldn’t rob me simply because I had no money. That was the main thing to look out for around here. We got to the woods and I had actually begun to doze off a bit because it was really late and I was tired and the whiskey was doing its part. George tapped me on the shoulder and told me that we had reached our destination. He jumped out of the caravan and took a shovel out of the wagon that had laid there on the floor. He looked for a spot in the ground that would suit his needs and planted the shovel  into the ground. He then told me to help him get all of the bags out of the wagon and put them beside it. The bags were quite heavy. Furthest from all the bags was a tent that had been rolled up. When I took a closer look at it it seemed to be used to wrap something. It was quite dark however and I couldn’t really tell anything apart too well. Not to mention that we had just drank. After we got the bags out of the way, George got in the wagon and told me to take the one end of the tent and help him take it out. I got back up on the wagon and reached for one of the ends As I grabbed it a shock went through my spine and I froze up. George sighed and kept looking down.
“Don’t worry. It’s alright. Just help me get it out and on the ground. I’ll explain everything.”
I didn’t hesitate because I couldn’t really think straight. I just did as he told me.
After we had put it on the ground we stood above the tent and George lit a cigarette. He offered me one and I accepted it.
“That’s Sir James Blackwell I’m afraid…” George said as he exhaled the cigarette fumes. “My soon to be Father In Law.”
I looked up at him but he was looking away from me. Seemingly fixated at something in the distance, but nothing in particular at the same time.
“I didn’t expect to haul a body tonight..” I replied to him.
“Neither did I.”

George went to grab the shovel and stomped it in the ground again. He dug up a piece of dirt and threw it nearby. I looked at him as he did so, looking at the wrapped up tent every now and then. My mind was trying to process the situation I was in right now. The whiskey wasn’t helping.
“I’ll dig for a bit and then we’ll switch.I have to save some energy for my east. That’s why I needed your help.”
I sat by as George dug the grave. After a while he rested for a bit and gave me the shovel. As he sat on the ground he lit another cigarette and asked me if I still wanted to know what happened. I told him that I did.

George had been on the road from Achersville to Somerton. That was where Sir James Blackwood lived. Achersville was nearby westward from my town. Tomorrow was George's wedding. He will be marrying Melina, Blackwood's daughter. George and Melina lived in Somerton so he had made the trip to Achersville to see Blackwood. After a few days there they would ride in the wagon back to Somerton. What we didn’t know was that a damned someone by the name of Stanley Arthur Wilson had been following them. He was a man who had a problem with Blackwood and had had one for a long time. About midway from Acherston to Somerton, Wilson had caught up with the two. It didn’t take long before things escalated to violence. Guns were drawn and bullets flew. Wilson shot first and unlucky Blackwood got shot in the gut. George shot back at Wilson but didn’t get him, only shooting his horse. As Wilson ran for cover to a nearby hill George took Blackwood into the wagon and made off while he still could. Wilson kept firing at the wagon. He got stranded there with no means of transportation so he couldn’t chase far after them.
The bastard had got his, however. “Poor Blackwood died along the way… If only I’d been smarter and done something about that crazy freak this man would still be alive…”
 After these words George stopped and looked at the ground. He looked at the wrapped body of Blackwood and then looked up at the sky.
“Let’s get this over with…”
He took the shovel as he saw that I’d already gotten quite tired of throwing dirt around. and kept digging. I sat where he had been sitting by the wagon. The horse was sitting patiently on the ground closing its eyes for longer periods now and then. It also looked like it had quite a day behind him and another one coming.
“So he’s still out there. Wilson.” I asked George to break the silence.
“Indeed he is. May lightning strike him down.” George said without stopping his digging. The grave was already taking shape but wasn’t yet deep enough. I asked George about what Blackwood had done to deserve such an unfortunate faith. He didn’t seem like talking anymore and like what he’d told me had already been too much. He spoke up however with a tone that told me that he didn’t even care about how much I know at this point.
“Wilson is no good. That’s for sure. Ask anybody and they’ll tell you the same thing.”
You could tell that George had a deep hatred for the man.
He had a grudge against old Blackwood here for a long time. It wasn’t too big of a surprise, what happened, looking back at it.”
It was some land dispute. Wilson thought that Blackwood had taken over land that he legally owned even though Blackwood had legally acquired it. That was just the beginning. After that Wilson accused Blackwood of stealing from him, slandering his name around town and ultimately putting him out of business. That morning Blackwood had talked to him and Wilson had argued with him yet again. He had told him that he would get what he deserves soon enough.
“I suppose that was the final straw for him.” George said while looking at the hole that was dug. 
George switched with me again and we did so a couple more times until the grave was deep enough. George went to Blackwood's body and opened up the wraps to say his last goodbyes. I stood back, leaning on the shovel. For a moment I got to see the old man's face. His white mustache was all I could see in the night's darkness. 
“He’ll get what he deserves. No matter what it takes.
He told Blackwood that he would take good care of his daughter and that he doesn’t have to worry about a thing. George said as he reached in the breast pocket of his jacket to take a little whiskey bottle. He took a sip and passed it my way.

After we’d buried Blackwood and closed his grave up with dirt , me and George found a large stone nearby and rolled it to the grave top to serve as the old man's gravestone. The last thing George did was throw a cross across his chest. We got back into the wagon, put the bags that we’d put on the ground earlier and set back to the town. On the way back we barely spoke at all. George was just saying something to himself.
“Better to leave him here. I can't just waltz there with the bride's dead father in the back of my wagon. Who knows how she’d take it.”
I tried to listen to him but I kept dozing off. I tried  hard not to sleep however.
“Could you pass that bag here?” George asked me as he was steering the wagon.
I took the bag that he’d pointed to and passed it up to him. He opened it and took out three stacks of money and then passed them to me.
“Thank you for your help.” George said as he handed me what was in his hands.
I took the money and looked at it for a while before putting it in the inside pocket of my jacket. George kept his eyes on the road.

We arrived back in town and said our goodbyes. He told me to be careful with that money. I thanked him again and he rode off. He also handed me a pistol and told me that I should better have one. By that point I was beyond exhausted.

The next morning I woke up in a room I had rented for the night with the money that George had given me. I thought to myself for a bit if what had happened the night before was real or not. I took my jacket to see if the money that he’d given me was there and after I confirmed that it was I knew that last night wasn’t just a deluded dream I had.
I got dressed and sat on the bed thinking of what I should best do with the money. One thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to leave this town and go somewhere else because there was nothing for me here. I remembered about Somerton and how George had described it to me. It seemed like a place that would suit me better than this place here. After counting the money that I had I figured that I would go and buy a horse to ride to Somerton. I’ll see about the rest later. Maybe I’d even meet George again when there.

I went to the stables in town where a fellow by the name of Dowell sold horses. He greeted me with a big smile that he probably had reserved for people who potentially would give him money. He showed me the horses that he had. I looked at all of them but I needed some time to figure out which one was best for me. At the stables was another gentleman who was also buying a horse. I found out that he was from Achersfield, just as Blackwood had been. We talked for a bit and I told him that I was leaving this town for Somerton, to find work. He told me that Somerton was no good and that I should come to Achersfield. He said that he’d be willing to give me work there, working at the mine. He’s going to need more people working for him now. I told him that I’d think about it. I remembered Achersville because that is where George had ridden from with Blackwood. The man told me that there's good money to be made. He said if I make up my mind, I will look for Blackwood mines. It didn’t hit me at first but I realized that it was none other than the infamous Stanley Wilson that George had told me about and the very man who’d gunned down the old fellow I buried last night. I knew I had to get back at him, for George and Blackwood. The man then went to Dowell to pay for the horse and left. I bought mine too. I thought for a while what I should do. I had set my mind to going to Somerton to find work. But I saw another opportunity here. If I went to Achersfield, maybe I could figure out a way to get back at Wilson. He doesn’t know me. I would blend in with the rest of the workers. I could probably come up with some sort of a plan. Wilson had left a daughter without a father and son in law without the business that he’d rightfully deserve. I knew how it feels to have something taken away from you and you and being powerless in face of loss. I couldn’t make anyone pay for my fathers death. I could make Wilson pay for what he’d taken however. I would make sure of that. I turned my horse around and set my sights on Achersfield.
